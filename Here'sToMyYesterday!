Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterdayAll these years I've been searching
For who I'm supposed to be
All this time I've been wasting
'Cause I was right in front of meOh, it's a crooked old tradition
By a masterful magician
But in all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no
Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
YesterdayOh, I'm a hopeless crash collision
'Cause I'm a hostage to my pride
By my own volition
I've been a saint, i've been the truth, I've been the lieOh, it's a crooked old tradition
By a masterful magician
But in this all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no
Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
YesterdayA new day you can go, you can do anything you wanna
It's your play, swing low, go high
Anywhere you wanna
You can reach for the moon
Anywhere your dreams can take you
Go astray, fade away
Just leave it to yesterdayHere's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
Yesterday
